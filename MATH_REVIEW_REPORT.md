   let mean = 0;
   let m2 = 0;
   for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
     const x = arr[i];
     const delta = x - mean;
     mean += delta / (i + 1);
     const delta2 = x - mean;

   }
   ```
   This is textbook-perfect numerical stability.

## Test Coverage Observations

The library uses **example-based testing** through JSDoc examples rather than separate test files:
- Only 2 test files found (runtime tests)
- Each function includes multiple worked examples in documentation
- Examples serve as both documentation and verification

**Recommendation:** While the JSDoc examples are excellent, consider adding:
- Comprehensive unit test suite
- Property-based testing for mathematical identities
- Numerical accuracy regression tests
