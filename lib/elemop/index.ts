 * @module elemop
 * @description Element-wise operations on arrays and matrices
 *
 * This module provides utilities for:
 * - Arithmetic operations (plus, minus, times, divide, power, etc.)
 * - Comparison operations (eq, ne, gt, ge, lt, le)
 * - Cumulative operations (cumsum, cumprod, cummax, cummin, cumdev)
 * - Rounding operations (ceil, floor, round, mod, rem)
 * - Other operations (dot, diff, prod, sum, unique)
